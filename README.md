## Emotion detector using VGG-Face

This project was carried out on the occasion of the 2021 edition of the Cassiop√©e Project of Telecom SudParis. The objective was to create a program that detects the face of an individual using OpenCV and then to detect the emotion of the associated face. 

A transfer-learning method with VGG-16 was used to train emotion detection. The training, validation and test databases were taken from the **CK48+** and **FER2013** databases. 
More details are available in the report.
